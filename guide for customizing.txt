I. For editing the surfaces :
	1). open gamedata/scripts/trans_outfit.script or visual_memory_manager.script if you're using stealth addon patch
	2). Ctrl + F search for "camo_surfaces" or scroll till you see it
         
		 camo_surfaces = {"earth", "dirt", "grass", "bush"}

	these are the material surfaces that enables camoflauges.
	The other known surfaces are wood, water, metal, tin, gravel, asphalt, tile, concrete, shifer, bricks, cloth, fake, 
	ladders, glass, sand, setka, stucco, tree, barrel, body, furniture, weapon which are not included for obvious reasons. 
	3). You can add/remove/replace surfaces following the same syntax of double quotes,
	spaces and comas


	For those who don't have MCM(big mistake, get it now) :
	change the values in at the top of the script
	ghil_blindness_koeff = 60
	ghil_fov_koeff = 130

	The trans_outfit.script isn't too hard to understand, you can change the multipliers for stance_fov, weather_fov, 
	stance_k, weather_mult, time_mult to customize your experience

II. For patching any conflict issues:
	patches for HD models and THAP are provided, but if you have another outfit addon that conflicts with o_lcs.ltx, 
	open the file from my addon, just scroll to the bottom and copy everything starting from    
	 "[ghillie_outfit]:outfit_base"    
	and just paste it over it's corresponding section in your current one(be sure to take a backup just in case)
